### About
This is an attempt at creating a site for a sports team where the team members can log in and:
* Read and post on a wall
* See upcoming events (games, workouts, ...)
* RVSP on upcoming events (games, workouts, ...)
* Dispaly a members list with contact info and player info

### Dependencies
* AuthLogic for authentication - https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic
* jquery-rails for registering jQuery instead of Prototype - original location: https://github.com/indirect/jquery-rails but I use a patched version hwo worked on my machine: https://github.com/pgericson/jquery-rails

### Installation

Coming soon ...

### Disclamer
This is my first ever Ruby and Rails project so things might be totally wrong... Please tell me if you catch something

Some things will be hardcode in Sweish until we/I get to the localization part (which in time of writing is far ahead)
